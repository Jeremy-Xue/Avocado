From the client: 
* Need to implement the changes to the welcome screen as discussed. 

* On the farmer-initiated transaction, we followed all the way through to the transporter matches page, but the sequence stops there. Need to get to the confirmation and the final transaction pages -- this is what we will want to show both farmers and potential partners like banks.

* On location, we really liked the drop pins and the ability to change locations/quantities.  An idea, if there is connectivity: when a farmer is inputting the photo of their farm as part of their profile, can we have a pin automatically dropped for the farm (avoiding the need for them to input an address?)

* On the transporter side, we need to get a demo that would cover what transporters can do (as we now have with farmers).  This would include checking places to pick up (the match) plus possible the "how full is your truck" functionality for transporters, if doable

* For the profile set-up, we would need to see the uploaded personal photos and photos of their location (for farmers).  For the farm images, imagine you are the driver, coming for the first time -- what would you see at the pick-up location?  How would you know you were "there".

* On the transporter side, we would like to see an uploaded picture of truck, license plate, and upload driver picture

* Last for now, once the driver and farmer have agreed on pickup, we will want the ability to have notifications and confirmations related to the finished transaction -- to show being on my way, to say one or the other party might be delayed, to send word that "I'm arriving" or "will be late".  We would like to see the dummy versions of those such as: confirm day of/change, notifications about delays/arrivals via SMS, Phone Contact via the app.
